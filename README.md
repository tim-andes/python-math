This repository contains two Python modules for basic mathematical operations and unit testing. Goal is to teach, review, learn, practice TDD, unit testing, pair programming, and communication on a project.

# Current Progress
math_class.py: This module defines a function add for adding two numbers.
test_math_class.py: This module contains unit tests to verify the functionality of the add function.

# Installation:
There is no installation required for this basic code. You can directly run the Python scripts or import them into other projects.

# Testing
Testing:

To run the unit tests, navigate to the directory containing these files and execute the following command in your terminal:
```
python test_math_class.py
```

# TO DO
- [ ] extend test suite for more edge cases
- [ ] create full arithmetic suite
- [ ] reframe as lesson / tutorial
- [ ] algebra
- [ ] trigonometry
- [ ] statistics
